**Push builds to itch.io with a single click of a button from the Godot editor**

# ðŸ›  How to Use

You'll need to [download itch.io's Butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/installing.html) for this to work. Add it to your PATH variable so it's availabe everywhere, and you're done with that part!

1. You can use Butler in the command line to **log in**, but Majordomo also has a log in button. Press it, authorize itch.io, and you're ready to build your game.
2. Select the **folder** you will store your exported builds in. This has to be a folder ONLY for that purpose.
  - Inside that folder, add sub-folders for each channel you want to push to. E.g: windows, linux, mac, html5.

4. Now fill in everything needed in the Majordomo dock, then click deploy all/select only a few to deploy. You have your game up on itch.io! Congrats!

All buttons have tooltips if you get lost.
